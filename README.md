# QuantumQueue 

>"Collapsing Wait Times into Opportunities"

QuantumQueue is not just a tool; it's your personal productivity accelerator. By harnessing the uncertainty of waiting periods, it transforms potential downtime into a springboard for progress, aligning with the three core features of your innovative tool- 

- Quantum Detection: Like observing particles, QuantumQueue detects when you've entered a waiting state, using smart algorithms to understand that you're in a holding pattern, needing to pause your primary task.
- Quantum Utilization: During the wait, QuantumQueue suggests micro-tasks, educational tidbits, or relaxation techniques, tailored to the length of the pause. This ensures that your waiting time is not just spent, but invested in activities that enrich your skills or well-being.
- Quantum Transition: As soon as the wait is over, QuantumQueue notifies you with a gentle nudge, not just pulling you back to your task but also mentally preparing you to re-enter your work zone with minimal friction and maximum focus.

With QuantumQueue, every pause in your workflow is an opportunity to engage with productive or restorative actions, ensuring that when the wait ends, you're sharper and more prepared than ever to tackle your tasks.

## How to run
- (consider to setup a pythong virtualenv)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python main.py`

## The handwritten explanation from which the above was generated:

I want to build on a desktop software that helps knowledge workers to stay in the "flow" when they work.

I'm often get distracted from the task at hand when I'm waiting.

The tool has 3 feature branches that will mature over time/get more sophisticated:

1. Detect the Waiting - It will need to understand that I'm waiting for something to complete.
2. Help me spend the time waiting - What should I do while I wait?
3. End Waiting - Notify my when waiting is over and gently return me to the task at hand.
